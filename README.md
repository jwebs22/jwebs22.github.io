# College Audition Monologue Finder

Monologues used for the program will always be from published plays, in the appropriate age range for students auditioning for college, and fit the guidelines for Common Prescreen (though users may need to edit for time).

# Why Though?

There is not one single good, free source for such monologues. You're expected to sit and read a ton of plays in your spare time (Ha.), or purchase monologues books that might not have one single usable suggestion, or spend a load of cash on College Audition Coaches. 

# How to use it

Select the gender, genre/type of monologue, and whether you want contemporary or classical (now defined as pre-1950). A list will generate for all the plays fitting that category that displays Play Title, Author, and the year it was written.

Select "Load" and the play info will generate in the cards below.

You will see a preview of the monologue that you can load into a new window, or a print window.

There are also some links, tips, and books that I found helpful.
