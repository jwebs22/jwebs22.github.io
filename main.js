I'm stricken. <br>(The others shrink back.) <p>Mother of God, I'm not ready. I've only just been born and now I have to die. All the fault of writers - cock-pimping scribblers. They've prepared the way. Always writing stories where some characters are important and others just disposable stock - First Attendant, Second Peasant, Third Guard. Stories're easier when 'tisn't possible to care for everyone equal. That's how itty-bitty-bit people like me come to be butchered on battlefields, die in droves on a hoo-hooo-oooh. <p>But we First Attendants are important too. We've lives. I've lodged in the chaffinch, lived in the flower, seen the sun coming up. I've discovered unbelievable things. I'm an extraordinary person. I'll tell you a secret... <br>(He dies. Scarron and Druce enter quickly Upstage Centre and hook him off with them).`,

I went to church and lit a candle, man. <p> I was like in the fifth grade and I was watching these two hamburgers on some practice court, and they took a break and one of them hands me his racket. So I threw up a toss like I'd seen them do and zap! Three inches over the net, two inches inside the line. There wasn't nobody over there, but that was an ace, man. You should have heard those guys razz me. I mean, you know, they say, Man, you stink. And all those things you can't repeat in front of a priest. <p> They was really on my case. And I think that's the first time anybody ever looked at me. I mean, I was skinny, you've never seen --most of the girls in my homeroom had about twenty pounds on me. So this guy shows me a back-hand grip and he hits one to me and zap! You mother! Backhand! Right down the line. And the thing is, that's where I wanted it. I saw the ball come at me, and I said I'm gonna backhand this sucker right down the line, and I did. So then they took their ball back. Which I don't blame them, cause no high school hotshot is gonna get off on being showed up by this eleven-year-old creep that's built like a parking meter, you know? <p> But that was it. I hit that first ball and I said, This is me. This is what I do. What I do is tennis. And once you know, then there's no way out. You've been showed something. Even if it's just tennis, you can't turn around and say you wasn't showed that.",

To be at the beginning again, knowing almost nothing. <p> People were talking about the end of physics. Relativity and quantum looked as if they were going to clean out the whole problem between them. A theory of everything. But they only explained the very big and the very small. The universe, the elementary particles. The ordinarysizes stuff which is our lives, the things people write poetry about - clouds -daffodils - waterfalls- and what happens in a cup of coffee when the cream goes in - these things are full of mystery, as mysterious to us as the heavens were to the Greeks. <p> We’re better at predicting events at the edge of the galaxy or inside the nucleus of an atom than whether it’ll rain on auntie’s garden party three Sundays from now. Because the problem turns out to be different. We can’t even predict the net drip from a dripping tap when it gets irregular. Each drip sets up the conditions for the next, the smallest variation blows prediction apart, and the weather is unpredictable the same way, will always be unpredictable.<p> When you push the numbers through the computer you can see it on the screen.

It's a big country and a beautiful one; it has lots of wonderful places in it. <p>Just think, Ánya: your grandfather, and his father, and his father's fathers, they owned the people who slaved away for them all over this estate, and now the voices and faces of human beings hide behind every cherry in the orchard, every leaf, every tree trunk. Can't you see them? And hear them? And owning human beings has left its mark on all of you, Look at your mother and your uncle! They live off the labor of others, they always have, and they've never even noticed! They owe their entire lives to those other people, people they wouldn't even let walk through the front gate of their beloved cherry orchard! This whole country has fallen behind; it'll take us at least two hundred years to catch up. <p> The thing is, we don't have any real sense of our own history; all we do is sit around and talk, talk, talk, then we feel depressed, so we go out and get drunk. If there's one thing that's dear to me, it's this: if we want to have any real life in the present, we have to do something to make up for our past, we have to get over it, and the only way to do that is to make sacrifices, get down to work, and work harder than we've ever worked before. Do you understand what I mean, Anya?",
